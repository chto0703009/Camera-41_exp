# Camera-41_exp v0.1.4 - 2026-10-27

- Choose LibRaw for the physical ARM/Intel Mac CPU, including when MATLAB runs under Rosetta.
- Inspect actual Mach-O slices before accepting named readers or unsuffixed fallbacks; reject a foreign-only fallback.
- Execute RAW decoding without shell interpolation; require matching dependencies during local rebuilds.
- Include private Python preparation and transfer-permission repair from the portable-startup work.
- Update Swedish and English handbooks, summaries and installation instructions to v0.1.4.

Validation: ARM LibRaw 0.22.1 startup, both architecture-selection cases, fallback rejection and full EXP release regressions. Physical Intel execution is not newly qualified. Original RAW files and exposure calculations are preserved. EXP has no ExifTool dependency.

## Historical releases

# Camera-41_exp v0.1.3

- Use English throughout the app, warnings, result tables, charts and Python/LibRaw preparation dialogs.
- Ship the unified isolated Python 3.13.6 environment setup and native architecture checks.
- Preserve the existing exposure calculations and original RAW files.

Private measurements and local virtual environments are excluded. Existing scientific acceptance is unchanged.

Validation: see [release checks](docs/releases/validation-v0.1.3.json). Archives are built from the committed sources with per-file SHA-256 manifests.
